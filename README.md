# AloneAmongTheStars

Motivation: This application was developed as an online repository to play the solo RPG, Alone Among the Stars. The original game is played with a deck of cards and 6-sided dice. You roll the dice to tell you how many cards to select. This is your 'planet' you are exploring. Each card offers a writing prompt based on the suit and number. Each prompt goes into a ship's log. For the online version, you need only click the button to get a planet. Then, you click each card to be given the writing prompt.

To Do: Functionality still needs to be added to save each log entry.
